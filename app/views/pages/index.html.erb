        Freshreader is a simple, open-source read-it-later app with a twist: <b>saved items disappear after 7 days</b>. This way, your list doesn't grow infinitely, and you can focus on what really matters.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Imagine you have a browser window filled with dozens of open tabs so small you can't even read the titles anymore. Let's tidy that up with Freshreader.
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="how-it-works-box flex-1">
        <h3>1. Save for later 📌</h3>
        <p>
          Use the browser extensions (available for Firefox and Chrome), the Android app (iOS on the way!), or the bookmarklet to save content to your Freshreader list to read later.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-it-works-box flex-1">
        <h3>2. Read up 👀</h3>

        <p>
          When you feel like it, open up your Freshreader list and read what you find interesting from the content you saved.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-it-works-box flex-1">
        <h3>3. Let go of the rest 🦉</h3>

        <p>
          Freshreader automatically declutters your reading list for you by letting go of saved content after 7 days</b>. This way, your list doesn't grow infinitely, and you can focus on what's relevant today.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The mindset to have when using Freshreader is this: <b>if something's important enough, it'll somehow make its way back into your life</b>. There's no need to try and consume everything today: read what makes sense today, and trust that the future will bring you what you need. ✌️

      It's such a good idea and definitely the twist I was looking for as I often find myself saving articles and never looking back at them. Thanks for creating this 🙂
