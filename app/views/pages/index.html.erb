        Freshreader is a simple, open-source reading list app with a twist: <b>saved content disappears after 7 days</b>. This way, your list doesn't grow infinitely, and you can focus on what's relevant <i>today</i>. What joy!

      <h3>Save content from anywhere on the Web ðŸ¦‹</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a browser window with tabs so small we can't even read the titles anymore, and you frequently think "I'll read/watch this later", but actually never do, then you'll love Freshreader. 
      </p>

      <p>Use the browser extensions (available for Firefox and Chrome), the Android app (iOS on the way!), or the bookmarklet to save content to your list.

      <h3>Let go of old saved content ðŸ¦‰</h3>

      <p>
        Marie Kondo was right: clutter is unhealthy. Freshreader declutters your reading list for you by letting go of saved content after 7 days</b>. This way, your list doesn't grow infinitely, and you can focus on what's relevant today. What's more, if we don't read something within 7 days of finding it, it's likely we won't read it the next week either, so best to just let go of it.
      </p>

      <h3>Trust that the future will resurface the important stuff ðŸ¦¢</h3>

      <p>
        If something's important enough, it'll somehow make its way back into your life. There's no need to try and consume everything today: read what makes sense today, and trust that the future will bring you what you need.

      It's such a good idea and definitely the twist I was looking for as I often find myself saving articles and never looking back at them. Thanks for creating this ðŸ™‚
