      In the past week, <%= User.all.map(&:articles).map(&:size).reject(&:zero?).size %> accounts were active.

    <li>
      In the past week, <%= User.where('created_at > ?', 7.days.ago).size %> accounts were created.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is currently a total of <%= User.count %> accounts. This includes accounts that don't have any activity.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These numbers do not include deleted accounts.</p>

  <h2>Saved items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Collectively, Freshreader users currently have <%= Article.where('created_at > ?', 7.days.ago).size %> items saved in their lists. Some of those will likely never be read, and that's perfectly okay! ğŸ™‚
    </li>
