# Freshreader

Save content to read later. Read what's most interesting. **Get a fresh start every week.**

Drawing inspiration from Instapaper and Pocket, Freshreader aims to be the place where you save content from around the Web to enjoy later. The major difference is this: Freshreader automatically lets go of saved content after 7 days. No more massive reading backlog: just what is still relevant.

Don't worry â€” if it's important, it'll somehow come back into your life.

Made using Ruby on Rails.
